## Resources and tools

(Just putting a list here for now. May expand into its own page if it gets too long)

### Mozilla Mortar

Some templates that can be used as starting point:

* [App stub](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-app-stub) - ultra minimal app template with a manifest and code for installing it.
* [Game stub](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-game-stub) - game app stub

[Full list](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar) of Mortar repositories.

### Development tools

* [Yeoman generator for Firefox OS](https://github.com/pdi-innovation/generator-firefoxos) - if you find the idea of typing ```yo firefoxos``` quite funny, you'll love this one. Provides a set of command line tools for common tasks such as pushing apps to the device or reading their logs. Here's a [webcast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOQVuAfCDHc).

## "Hacking"

"Advanced topics", for power users and tinkerers.

* [Running Gaia on your computer](chapters/hacking-running-gaia-on-your-computer.md)

## Miscellanea: questions without answers (yet)

Either I don't know the answer or haven't had time to write it. Feel free to do it yourself: pull requests are _very_ welcome!

* How to brand Gaia. Make your phone truly yours. Change initial animation, look and feel, ringtones, etc.
* How to flash a custom Gaia build onto a phone.
* Is there an emulator, Ã  la Android QEMU-based emulator?
